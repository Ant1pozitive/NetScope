# NetScope

> Universal diagnostics platform for neural networks.

NetScope is an open-source framework for inspecting, diagnosing, and understanding neural networks.

The project is designed to evolve from model observation toward actionable diagnostics and engineering recommendations.

## Project Vision

NetScope follows a three-stage workflow:

```text
Observe
    ↓
Diagnose
    ↓
Recommend
```

The long-term goal is to answer engineering questions such as:

* Why did the model fail?
* Which layers are underutilized?
* Which neurons are inactive?
* Where do gradients become unstable?
* Which components are redundant?
* What can be safely pruned?
* Which runtime settings should be changed?

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Quick Start

### Inspect a Python object

```python
from netscope import Inspector

inspector = Inspector()
result = inspector.inspect({"hello": "world"})

print(result.summary())
print(result.to_dict())
```

### Build a snapshot from an inspection result

```python
from netscope import Inspector, SnapshotBuilder

inspector = Inspector()
result = inspector.inspect({"hello": "world"})

snapshot = SnapshotBuilder().from_result(result)

print(snapshot.to_dict())
```

### Build an FX graph

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from netscope import FXGraphBuilder

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(4, 8),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(8, 2),
)

graph = FXGraphBuilder().build(model)
print(graph.to_dict())
```

### Build a layer tree

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from netscope import LayerTreeBuilder

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(4, 8),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(8, 2),
)

tree = LayerTreeBuilder().build(model)
print(tree.to_dict())
```

### Attach recursive hooks

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from netscope import ForwardHookAdapter, HookManager

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(4, 8),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(8, 2),
)

manager = HookManager(module=model)
adapter = ForwardHookAdapter(manager)

def callback(module, inputs, output):
    return output

group = adapter.attach(model, callback)
print(group.snapshot())
```

### Work with a snapshot model

```python
from netscope import Snapshot, SnapshotMetadata, SnapshotSummary

snapshot = Snapshot(
    metadata=SnapshotMetadata(
        inspector_name="demo",
        session_id="sess-001",
        session_state="running",
        target_type="dict",
    ),
    summary=SnapshotSummary(
        model_name="example",
        model_type="dict",
    ),
)

print(snapshot.to_dict())
```
